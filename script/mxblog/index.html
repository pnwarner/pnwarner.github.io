                This is a demonstration of the current MxBlog Reader UI in its development stage. The blog file being loaded as an example is from my project site: <a href="http://paradoxresearch.net">paradoxresearch.net</a>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                ParadoxResearch.net and this page both load the same blog file.  The script can be configured for a simpler look like the one featured on ParadoxResearch.net, but can also contain much more information as shown on the article below.  You can look at which sections or items can be customized for display in the Menu. These options can be set by the site maintainer.
